Python Patterns and Refactoring
===============================

Catalog of implementation patterns & recommendations to refactoring for Python.

Main goal of this catalog is to collect Python implementation patterns, best 
practices and examples of refactoring that are relevant for Python software.

This catalog is intended for:

- Learning Python Programming.
- Referencing during Pair Programming.
- Referencing during Code Review.

Status
------
Currently catalog is in state of early forming, so information, format of its 
representation and, actually, everything else, could be changed very massively 
and frequently.

Python version
--------------

All examples will be presented using latest of Python 3 versions and 
will be based on Python 3 standard library.

3rd party libraries
-------------------

Some examples may require installation of 3rd party libraries. All required 
libraries will always be listed in example's description.
